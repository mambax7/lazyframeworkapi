# 1-2 Admin

Here on the `admin`directory, the file will be used to do a few instructions

The rest are built-in files, no need to change.

In the background, only groups that have management rights for the module can enter, so it is not necessary to judge the permissions functionally \(because XOOPS will automatically check\)
