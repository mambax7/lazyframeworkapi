# 1-1 Front End

Most of the front-end files can be set once, such as `xoops_version.php`, `function.php`etc., and the rest are almost unnecessary.

In addition, the front page can basically be viewed by groups that have the right to use the module. Therefore, if some management functions are useful, you need to pay special attention to the settings of the permissions.

`index.php`The page is a sample file of the foreground page. If there are three pages in the foreground, you can `index.php`copy three copies, change the file name, and change the data table and primary key called inside.
