# 3-4 Form component

This series of methods are used to allow you to adjust the appearance and function of the newly added \(or edited\) form, so it is generally used in `create`or `edit`to allow the form to meet the flexible needs of development.

The forms generated by the lazy framework will automatically add tokens for verification during storage or update to avoid CSRF attacks \(Cross-site Request Forgery\).
